Preliminary thoughts on a computer language as a foreign language.

- Proficiency in a computer/artificial language should not be used to substitute
   knowledge of a foreign language.

- The decision to allow computer language substitution is not to be taken
lightly. The student will be asked to articulate the reasoning behind the
request in writing.

- There are two specific cases where computer language as a foreign language
is appropriate:

1. When a student's projected dissertation/thesis research involves aspects of
   computational culture. This includes topics in electronic literature,
software studies, game studies, online deliberation, combinatorial poetics,
virtual communities, fan culture, media studies, platform studies, sociology
of knowledge, book piracy, politics of the archive, human--computer
interaction, and history and future of the book (among other potentially
relevant applications). The student should describe the scope of his or her
project, relevant technologies involved, and a brief synopsis of secondary
literature in the proposed field of the kind that models an deep engagement
with a computer language. Specific languages in this category will often
include historical or otherwise obscure dialects. Examples from proposed
studies include *Fortran*, *6502 Assembler (Nintendo)*, *Perl*.

2. Computer languages are particularly appropriate in complement to other
   so-called "instrumental" languages. What are instrumental languages.
Methodology. The language should be a major "research language" which includes
*Python*, *R*, *C*, *Java*, or *Julia*. The list does not include markup
languages such as *HTML*, *CSS*, or *LaTeX*.
